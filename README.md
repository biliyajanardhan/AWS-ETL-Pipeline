# 🚀 AWS ETL Pipeline (S3 → Lambda → Glue → EventBridge → SNS | CloudWatch Monitoring)

This project demonstrates a fully automated **ETL Pipeline on AWS**, using serverless services including **Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, AWS Glue, Amazon EventBridge, Amazon SNS**, and monitoring with **CloudWatch**.  
The pipeline ingests raw data from S3, processes it using Glue ETL jobs, triggers events through EventBridge, and sends notifications using SNS.
